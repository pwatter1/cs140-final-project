# cs140-final-project-pippin
This repository includes all files associated to my final project in CS 140 Spring 2016.

Compile and run assembly files written in a modified Pippin assembly language as well as catch assembly, run-time, or syntax errors. 
Allows students to make the leap from writing programs in a simple high-level language to understanding how such programs come to 
be translated and executed on a simple computer.

Part of the code was written by Dr.Lander, my professor.
Please run Machine View to start.

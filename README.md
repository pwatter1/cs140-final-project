# cs140-final-project-pippin
This repository includes all files associated to my final project in CS 140 Spring 2016.

Compile and run assembly files written in a modified Pippin assembly language as well as catch assembly, run-time, or syntax errors. User can step through manually, let it run on its own with varying speeds, or simply execute the program. 
Allows students to make the leap from writing programs in a simple high-level language to understanding how such programs come to 
be translated and executed on a simple computer.

Please run Machine View to start and load a data file when prompted.
